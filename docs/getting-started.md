Hi, are you new to [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip)? If so, we recommend trying out our [web-client](https://chat.zulip.org) first to understand the concept of [streams/topics/PMs](https://zulip.com/help/about-streams-and-topics) in the world of Zulip. Just sending a message or two in [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) stream should help you get started.

Now let's help you get started with using zulip terminal. First, go ahead and complete the [installation](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#installation--running). If you encountered any issues, we have common issues and their solutions listed [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#troubleshooting-common-issues).
